<p><font size="5" face="verdana" color="blue"><p> Greely is a school with about 700 students in it. While I went to Greely, I ran Cross Country, Outdoor Track, and Indoor Track. I also played soccer during my freshman year. My favorite class I took at Greely was probably video production because it was fun to be able to create my own videos and be creative. </p></font></p>
